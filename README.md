# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in ReactJS

## Description
This Tic Tac Toe game is a fun and interactive web application built using ReactJS, HTML, and CSS. It demonstrates the use of React's `useState` hook and various coding patterns like Two-Way Binding, Immutable State Updates, and Lifting State Up. The project also explores advanced concepts like sharing state across components and performing deep copies of objects.

## Features
- Interactive Tic Tac Toe game interface.
- State management using React's `useState` hook.
- Implementation of Two-Way Binding for efficient form handling.
- Immutable state updates to ensure state consistency.
- Lifting state up to share state across components.
- Techniques for deep copying objects to prevent direct state mutation.
